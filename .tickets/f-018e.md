# Wire fmail into build + release (Makefile/goreleaser)

Ensure fmail is built, installed, and released alongside forge/forged.

Scope:
- Add cmd/fmail to the repo
- Update Makefile targets (build, install, build-all) to include fmail
- Update .goreleaser.yaml so releases produce the fmail binary for supported platforms

## Acceptance Criteria

- `make build` produces build/fmail
- `make install` installs fmail alongside forge/forged
- Goreleaser config includes fmail in release artifacts
