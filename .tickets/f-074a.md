# Implement fmail --robot-help

Implement machine-readable help output for AI agents.

Required behavior:
- `fmail --robot-help` prints a single JSON object on stdout matching docs/forge-mail/ROBOT-HELP.md.
- Include name, version, description, setup string, commands map, patterns, env vars, message format, and storage paths.

Notes:
- Keep it self-contained and copy/paste-ready for agents.
- Future versions should only add fields (avoid breaking changes).

## Acceptance Criteria

- `fmail --robot-help` outputs valid JSON (single object)
- Output matches the fields and examples in docs/forge-mail/ROBOT-HELP.md
- Includes correct version string (wire to build/versioning)
- Covered by a unit test that validates JSON shape and required keys


## Notes

**2026-01-11T08:25:00Z**

Implemented robot help output + version normalization; added tests. go test ./... fails in sandbox: permission denied in /root/.cache/go-build and httptest listen tcp6 not permitted.
