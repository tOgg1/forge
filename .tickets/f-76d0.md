# Implement fmail init + gc

Implement project initialization and cleanup utilities.

Commands (per docs/forge-mail/SPEC.md):
- fmail init
  - Initializes .fmail/ in current project root (usually auto-created, but init is explicit)
  - Supports `--project <id>` to set explicit project ID
  - Writes .fmail/project.json

- fmail gc
  - Deletes messages older than N days (default 7)
  - Supports `--days <n>` and `--dry-run`
  - Applies to topics/* and dm/*

## Acceptance Criteria

- `fmail init` creates .fmail/ and writes project.json with id + created timestamp
- `fmail init --project X` sets project.json id to X
- `fmail gc` removes messages older than 7 days by default
- `fmail gc --dry-run` reports what would be deleted without deleting
- Errors are safe and non-destructive (does not delete unexpected files)
