Start with agents in a circle\n  2. Iteratively: attract connected nodes, repel all nodes, settle after N iterations\n  3. Snap to character grid (each node occupies a rectangular area)\n  4. Max 12 agents displayed (combine least-active into an \"others\" node)\n- For rendering: use box-drawing characters (─│┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼) and arrows (→←↑↓)\n- Edge routing: simple Manhattan routing (horizontal then vertical) with collision avoidance\n- This view is optional/secondary — prioritize it being informative over perfectly laid out\n- Re-render only when time range changes or on explicit refresh, not on every message","status":"open","priority":"P2"}

[y/N]\"\n  - Each agent gets an individual DM (not a topic post)\n  - Or post to a configurable \"announcements\" topic\n- Multi-select: hold Ctrl and click/select multiple agents, compose one message sent to all\n- Group compose: create ad-hoc groups (e.g., \"frontend team\" = coder-1, coder-2, designer)\n  - `/group create frontend coder-1 coder-2 designer`\n  - `/group frontend <msg>` to message the whole group\n\n### Feedback & Approval Workflow\n- When an agent sends a message tagged \"question\" or \"needs-approval\":\n  - Message highlighted with a distinct border/badge\n  - Inline action buttons: [Approve] [Reject] [Reply]\n  - `y` to approve (sends reply tagged \"approved\")\n  - `x` to reject (opens compose for rejection reason)\n  - These appear in the notification panel AND in the conversation\n- Feedback templates:\n  - Quick reactions: `:thumbsup:`, `:thumbsdown:`, `:eyes:` — sent as short reply messages\n  - Template library: pre-written responses for common patterns\n    - \"Looks good, proceed\" / \"Hold off, let me review\" / \"Needs changes: ...\"\n  - Configurable templates in tui-state.json\n- Priority escalation: when you send a high-priority message, it gets a visual \"urgent\" treatment in the agent's view\n\n### Notification Integration\n- Unread message count per conversation shown in sidebar\n- Desktop notification (terminal bell) when an agent DMs you\n- Flash/highlight when an agent mentions your name in a topic\n- \"Waiting for reply\" indicators: if you asked a question >5m ago with no response, show a subtle reminder\n\n### Identity & Presence\n- Your identity prominently shown: \"you: tormod\" in the header\n- Set via `--agent` flag, `FMAIL_AGENT` env, or prompted on first launch\n- Your status: set with `/mystatus working on auth review` — visible to all agents\n- Auto-presence: TUI automatically registers you as an active agent while open\n  - Updates last_seen on every interaction\n  - Clears presence on exit (or marks as \"offline\")\n\n## Technical Notes\n- The operator console is a new view (not a replacement for the compose overlay)\n- It can be the DEFAULT view when launched with `fmail tui --operator` or `-o` flag\n- Conversation history: aggregated from DMs sent/received + topic messages where the user participated\n- For \"chat style\" rendering: track which messages are \"mine\" vs \"theirs\" based on FMAIL_AGENT identity\n- Quick action targets: computed from recent message history, refreshed on new messages\n- Slash command parser: split on first space, match command prefix, pass rest as args\n- Group storage: tui-state.json under a \"groups\" key: map[string][]string\n- Enter vs Ctrl+Enter: configurable in preferences, default is Enter=send for single-line\n- Auto-presence: tea.Tick every 30s to touch the agent registry file with updated last_seen\n- Broadcast: iterate over Agents() from data provider, send to each with @agent targeting","status":"open","priority":"P1"}
