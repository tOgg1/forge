# Forge TUI Accessibility Quick Modes (2026-02-13)

Task: `forge-1h3`

## Goal

Fast keyboard switching for accessibility-focused presets spanning contrast, typography density, and motion.

## Keybinding

- `A` in main mode cycles accessibility quick modes.

## Presets

- `contrast`
- theme: `high-contrast`
- density: `comfortable`
- motion: `full`

- `typography`
- theme: `colorblind-safe`
- density: `compact`
- motion: `full`

- `motion-reduced`
- theme: `low-light`
- density: `comfortable`
- motion: `reduced`

## Notes

- Quick modes are additive to existing `T` accessibility theme cycling.
- Status bar confirms active mode and resolved settings after each cycle.
