# Rollback Rehearsal Template Ready (2026-02-10)

Task: `forge-nbf`  
Status: template ready; execution pending staging/prod-like environment access

## Evidence

- Timing budget + log template added: `docs/rust-rollback-rehearsal-timing-budget-template.md`
- Runbook links to template: `docs/rust-post-cutover-incident-runbook.md`

## Blocker

- Need an environment where we can perform an actual Rust->Go rollback rehearsal and capture timings/logs.
